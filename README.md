# Hello

I am currently working on native iOS app development, Japanese localization & translation, and project management.

On the side, I research development of native iOS/macOS clients for services that would otherwise use Electron clients or websites. 

## Things I'm working on
- [Public Gists](https://gist.github.com/katagaki): a collection of Userscripts (mostly CSS) that attempt to fix the broken web, alongside other useful scripts
- [Buses](https://github.com/katagaki/Tsugi2): a native iOS app for Singapore's public bus services
- [Unagent](https://github.com/katagaki/BingMeUp): a Safari extension for iOS and macOS that changes the user agent served to specific websites
- [QuickUp](https://github.com/katagaki/QuickUp): a macOS client for ClickUp based on the ClickUp public API
