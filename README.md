# Hello

I am currently working on native iOS app development, Japanese localization & translation, and project management.

On the side, I research development of native iOS/macOS clients for services that would otherwise use Electron clients or websites. 

## Active iOS/macOS Apps
- [Buses](https://github.com/katagaki/Tsugi2): a native iOS app for Singapore's public bus services
- [Unagent](https://github.com/katagaki/Unagent): a Safari extension for iOS and macOS that changes the user agent served to specific websites
- [Hackers](https://github.com/katagaki/HackersJP): a Hacker News app for Japanese readers
- [Randomly](https://github.com/katagaki/Random): an iOS app that randomly generates several types of data
- [DiceyDice](https://github.com/katagaki/DiceyDice): a simple iOS app that rolls some dice
- [Tunetag](https://github.com/katagaki/Tunetag): an MP3 tag editor for iOS

## Old iOS/macOS Apps
- [QuickUp](https://github.com/katagaki/QuickUp): a macOS client for ClickUp based on the ClickUp public API
- [Guru](https://github.com/katagaki/Guru): a native iOS password manager with a unique take on password generation
