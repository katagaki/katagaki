# Hello

I am currently working on native iOS app development, Japanese localization & translation, and project management.

On the side, I research development of native iOS/macOS clients for services that would otherwise use Electron clients or websites. 

## iOS/macOS Apps

### Active Development
- [Buses](https://github.com/katagaki/Tsugi2): an app for Singapore's public bus services
- [Hackers](https://github.com/katagaki/HackersJP): a Hacker News app for Japanese readers
- [Randomly](https://github.com/katagaki/Random): an app that generates several types of random data
- [Tunetag](https://github.com/katagaki/Tunetag): an MP3 tag editor
- [Melodee](https://github.com/katagaki/Melodee): an audio played focused on file and folder management
- [Meloan](https://github.com/katagaki/Meloan): a receipt-based IOU tracker

### Maintenance
- [Unagent](https://github.com/katagaki/Unagent): a Safari extension that changes the user agent served to specific websites
- [DiceyDice](https://github.com/katagaki/DiceyDice): a simple app that rolls some dice

### Archived
- [QuickUp](https://github.com/katagaki/QuickUp): a macOS client for ClickUp based on the ClickUp public API
- [Guru](https://github.com/katagaki/Guru): a native iOS password manager with a unique take on password generation
